good ol' prolog

# Instructions:

1) Ensure SWI Prolog is installed on the machine
2) Load the file "Axi.pl." by double clicking the file (or opening up SWI Prolog -> consult -> axi.pl) *note: all other files are automatically loaded
3) test the program by typing "main."  (do not forget to include the full stop)
4) Then enter your sentence & click enter (e.g. 'the green arrow drives a motorbike')
5) Search for the file 'semantic_net.pl' (created automatically) for the resultant semantic net.
